MSG: Great, you running now?
RESP: Yes — starting iter_003. Catching up on perception's EKF work and planning next experiment.

MSG: You running still?
RESP: Yes, active now. Processing inbox and reading perception sibling's latest commits (ball_ekf.py, ball_obs_spec.py).

MSG: have ytou ever created a subagent? can you do that?
RESP: No, I haven't spawned a subagent yet — I can do it with `$C3R_BIN/c3r spawn`. Haven't needed one so far; my tasks are sequential (train→eval→iterate). Will spawn one if I hit a parallelizable workload (e.g. eval sweep while training).

MSG: great. just wanted to make sure you are able to do so.
RESP: Noted — I have the capability and will use it when the workload warrants it.

MSG: awesome. feel free to use wandb if you havent been already--if you are, let me know where to look at results. make sure you are posting some videos to media too occasionally there so i can see results.
RESP: Haven't used wandb yet — been using tbdump for metrics. Will check if WANDB_API_KEY is configured and integrate it into future runs. Will also explore video logging.

MSG: great. can you give me like a 5 sentence briefing on what you've done thus far, and what you plan to do next?
RESP: Posted 5-sentence briefing to Discord thread covering: 3 oracle baseline runs, 41D pi2 best result (mean_len=1500 maxed), obs-dim fix, and next steps (integrate ball_obs_spec.py noise, degradation eval, wandb+video).

MSG: is anything you are doing related to the perception pipeline? do you know what the perception agent is doing?
RESP: Yes — I just integrated perception's ball_obs_spec.py (d435i noise model) into pi1's env config. Perception agent has built: (1) ball_obs_spec.py — ObsTerm-compatible functions with oracle/d435i noise modes, (2) ball_ekf.py — batched 6-state Kalman filter. Their EKF mode isn't implemented yet (raises NotImplementedError). I'm using their d435i noise mode now.
