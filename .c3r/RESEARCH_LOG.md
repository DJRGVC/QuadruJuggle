## iter_001 — oracle pi1 baseline (500-iter, oracle ball obs)  (2026-04-07T19:30 PDT)
Hypothesis: Training pi1 for 500 iterations with oracle (noise-free) ball observations will advance the curriculum to at least Stage C–D and establish a clean reference metric for noise-injection comparison.
Change:     Launched fresh pi1 training run from scratch (no warm start); oracle obs; 4096 envs; 500 iters.
Command:    uv run --active python scripts/rsl_rl/train_juggle_hier.py \
              --task Isaac-BallJuggleHier-Go1-v0 \
              --pi2-checkpoint /home/daniel-grant/Research/QuadruJuggle/logs/rsl_rl/go1_torso_tracking/2026-03-12_09-04-32/model_best.pt \
              --num_envs 4096 --max_iterations 500 --headless
            # pi2 is the 41D (no last_action) checkpoint — matches current action_term.py
            # checkpoint saved to: logs/rsl_rl/go1_ball_juggle_hier/2026-04-07_19-11-34/model_best.pt
Result:     Training time 798s (13.3 min).  Reached Stage D (target=0.20 m) after 211 iters; spent
            remaining 289 iters in Stage D.
            At iter 499 (tbdump metrics):
              Train/mean_episode_length  : 1470.8 steps  (1500 max = 98% timeout)
              Episode_Termination/time_out: 92.4 %
              Episode_Termination/ball_below: 7.6 %  (ball_off: 0 %)
              Episode_Reward/ball_apex_height: 3.107  (needs 5.0 to advance to Stage E)
              Episode_Reward/alive:  0.976
              Train/mean_reward: 69.2
              Policy/mean_noise_std: 0.548  (converging, started at 0.5)
              Perf/total_fps: 125 K env-steps/s
            Stage advancement threshold at D: timeout≥75% (✓ 92%) AND apex≥5.0 (✗ 3.11).
            Policy survives near-perfectly (mean_len≈1470) but ball is NOT yet being juggled
            to the 20 cm apex; ball staying near paddle surface rather than being tossed.
            NOTE: Pre-existing pi1 checkpoint (2026-03-12_10-21-52, 150 iters) only worked
            at Stage A (0.05 m) when evaled. The 500-iter policy is clearly better (Stage D
            survival) but still short of Stage D graduation.
            NOTE: Latest pi2 checkpoint (2026-03-12_17-16-01) is 53D (includes last_action)
            and INCOMPATIBLE with current action_term.py (builds 41D obs).  Bug tracked in
            .c3r/fix_plan.md — needs action_term.py update to add last joint targets.
Decision:   Task 1 complete.  Next: Task 3 — build compare_pi1.py eval infrastructure that
            wraps eval_juggle_hier.py for systematic oracle-vs-noise comparison.  Will also
            note the action_term.py 41→53D bug for a separate fix iteration.

## iter_002 — Fix pi2 obs dim (41→53D) + re-run 500-iter oracle baseline  (2026-04-07T19:43Z)
Hypothesis: The latest pi2 checkpoint (2026-03-12_17-16-01) trained with 53D obs (41D + 12D last_action). action_term.py only builds 41D → shape mismatch crash. Adding last_action to the action term and re-running 500 iters with the best pi2 checkpoint will give a stronger baseline.
Change:     Added `_last_pi2_actions` (12D) buffer to `TorsoCommandAction` in action_term.py, appended to pi2_obs vector (41D→53D). Reinstalled go1_ball_balance editable package from worktree. Used latest pi2 (2026-03-12_17-16-01/model_best.pt, 53D, early-stopped).
Command:    `$C3R_BIN/gpu_lock.sh uv run --active python scripts/rsl_rl/train_juggle_hier.py --task Isaac-BallJuggleHier-Go1-v0 --pi2-checkpoint .../go1_torso_tracking/2026-03-12_17-16-01/model_best.pt --num_envs 12288 --max_iterations 500 --headless`
Result:
  - Training time: 1679s (~28 min), 12288 envs
  - Curriculum: A→B at iter ~333, B→C at iter ~353, stuck at Stage C (target=0.15m) by iter 500
  - Final metrics (iter 499):
    - mean_episode_length: 995.3 (of 1500 max)
    - mean_reward: 115.0
    - time_out %: 47% (needs 75% for C→D)
    - ball_apex_height: 4.44 (needs 5.0)
    - alive: 0.632, noise_std: 0.675
    - ball_off: 0.7%, ball_below: 52.6%
  - Checkpoint: logs/rsl_rl/go1_ball_juggle_hier/2026-04-07_19-43-53/model_best.pt
  - Compared to iter_001 (41D pi2, 4096 envs): WORSE. iter_001 reached Stage D with 92% timeout; iter_002 stuck at Stage C with 47% timeout. Possible causes: (a) 53D pi2 checkpoint is worse quality, (b) 12288 envs vs 4096 changes batch statistics, (c) pi2 last_action integration has a bug (zeros at first step → obs distribution mismatch).
Decision:   The 53D pi2 with last_action underperforms the 41D pi2 from iter_001. Next iteration should use the 41D pi2 checkpoint that worked in iter_001 (2026-03-12_09-04-32) — but first verify it exists on disk. If it does, re-run 500 iters with that pi2 and 12288 envs to get a clean Stage D+ baseline. The action_term fix (53D) is still correct and needed for the newest pi2, but the pi2 itself may have regressed.

## iter_003 — oracle baseline with 41D pi2 + 12288 envs  (2026-04-07T20:18Z)
Hypothesis: iter_002 regression was due to 53D pi2 quality, not env count. Using the proven 41D pi2 checkpoint with 12288 envs should give a stronger oracle baseline (higher timeout, better survival).
Change:     Same 41D pi2 as iter_001 (2026-03-12_09-04-32/model_best.pt) but 12288 envs (3× more than iter_001). action_term.py now auto-detects pi2 input dim → 41D path taken automatically.
Command:    uv run --active python scripts/rsl_rl/train_juggle_hier.py \
              --task Isaac-BallJuggleHier-Go1-v0 \
              --pi2-checkpoint .../go1_torso_tracking/2026-03-12_09-04-32/model_best.pt \
              --num_envs 12288 --max_iterations 500 --headless
            # checkpoint: logs/rsl_rl/go1_ball_juggle_hier/2026-04-07_20-18-34/model_best.pt
Result:     Training time 1683s (~28 min).  Stage transitions: A→B (~9 iters), B→C (+35 iters),
            C→D (+35 iters). Spent remaining ~280 iters in Stage D.
            At iter 499 (tbdump):
              Train/mean_episode_length  : 1500.0  ← MAXED OUT (1500 steps)
              Episode_Termination/time_out: 98.9%
              Episode_Termination/ball_below: 1.1%  (ball_off: 0%)
              Episode_Reward/ball_apex_height: 2.92  (needs 5.0 for Stage D→E advance)
              Episode_Reward/alive: 0.994
              Train/mean_reward: 78.5
              Policy/mean_noise_std: 0.337  (very converged)
              Perf/total_fps: 191 K env-steps/s (12288 envs much better GPU utilization)
            CONFIRMED: 53D pi2 was the culprit in iter_002, not env count.
            41D pi2 + 12288 envs gives BEST oracle baseline:
              iter_001 (41D, 4096): timeout=92.4%, mean_len=1470, Stage D
              iter_002 (53D, 12288): timeout=47%, mean_len=995, Stage C  ← worst
              iter_003 (41D, 12288): timeout=98.9%, mean_len=1500, Stage D ← BEST
            Ball is still not being actively juggled (apex_rew=2.92 vs 5.0 needed);
            the robot is maintaining the ball on the paddle at Stage D target height
            but not launching it to the apex. Policy is near local optimum.
Decision:   Oracle baseline is now solid. Proceed to fix_plan Task 3: write compare_pi1.py
            eval infrastructure. Also flag that longer training (>500 iters) may be needed
            to advance past Stage D — the apex reward is plateauing at ~3/5. Consider
            running 1000-iter warm-start from iter_003 checkpoint in a future iteration.

## iter_004 — integrate perception ball_obs_spec.py + smoke test d435i  (2026-04-08T03:50Z)
Hypothesis: Swapping the oracle obs terms for perception's `ball_pos_perceived` / `ball_vel_perceived` (in oracle mode) will produce identical training behavior, and d435i mode will run without errors.
Change:     (1) Copied perception's ball_obs_spec.py, ball_ekf.py, __init__.py to local branch.
            (2) Replaced ball_pos/ball_vel ObsTerms in ball_juggle_hier_env_cfg.py with
            `ball_pos_perceived` / `ball_vel_perceived` (default: oracle mode).
            (3) Added `--noise-mode oracle|d435i` CLI flag to train_juggle_hier.py.
            (4) Reinstalled go1_ball_balance package.
Command:    # Smoke test oracle:
            $C3R_BIN/gpu_lock.sh uv run --active python scripts/rsl_rl/train_juggle_hier.py \
              --task Isaac-BallJuggleHier-Go1-v0 \
              --pi2-checkpoint .../2026-03-12_09-04-32/model_best.pt \
              --num_envs 4 --max_iterations 2 --headless --noise-mode oracle
            # Smoke test d435i:
            same with --noise-mode d435i
Result:     Both smoke tests PASS (2 iterations each, no errors).
            Oracle: mean_reward iter 0→0.04, iter 1→1.59
            D435i:  mean_reward iter 0→0.98, iter 1→0.85
            Perception interface integrated successfully. Ready for full d435i training comparison.
Decision:   Next: run full 500-iter d435i training (same pi2, 12288 envs) to quantify degradation
            vs oracle baseline (iter_003: timeout=98.9%, apex=2.92). This is the core of
            the policy agent's mandate: measure noise impact and begin noise scheduling.

## iter_005 — d435i noise training comparison (500-iter, 12288 envs)  (2026-04-08T03:50Z)
Hypothesis: Training pi1 with d435i perception noise will degrade performance vs oracle baseline, providing the first noise-degradation measurement.
Change:     Ran pi1 training with --noise-mode d435i (D435i structured noise: 2mm XY, 3mm Z base, 2% dropout). Same pi2 (41D), same 12288 envs, 500 iters.
Command:    $C3R_BIN/gpu_lock.sh uv run --active python scripts/rsl_rl/train_juggle_hier.py \
              --task Isaac-BallJuggleHier-Go1-v0 \

              --num_envs 12288 --max_iterations 500 --headless --noise-mode d435i
            # checkpoint: logs/rsl_rl/go1_ball_juggle_hier/2026-04-07_20-53-29/model_best.pt
Result:     Training time 1724s (~29 min).
            Curriculum: A→B (iter ~204), B→C (iter ~220), C→D (iter ~240).
            Stage D stuck (same as oracle) — apex reward plateaus at ~2.9/5.0 needed.
            At iter 499:
              mean_episode_length: 1438.6  (oracle iter_003: 1500)
              time_out %: 85.2%  (oracle: 98.9%)
              ball_apex_height: 3.04  (oracle: 2.92)
              alive: 0.921  (oracle: 0.994)
              mean_reward: 72.2  (oracle: 78.5)
              noise_std: 0.548  (oracle: 0.337)
              ball_below: 14.8%  (oracle: 1.1%)
            
            COMPARISON SUMMARY:
            | Metric          | Oracle (iter_003) | D435i (iter_005) | Delta |
            |-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
            | mean_ep_len     | 1500              | 1439             | -4.1% |
            | timeout %       | 98.9%             | 85.2%            | -13.7pp |
            | apex_reward     | 2.92              | 3.04             | +4.1% |
            | ball_below %    | 1.1%              | 14.8%            | +13.7pp |
            | mean_reward     | 78.5              | 72.2             | -8.0% |
            | noise_std       | 0.337             | 0.548            | +63%  |
            
            KEY FINDING: d435i noise causes moderate degradation (~8% reward, ~14pp more ball drops)
            but does NOT prevent curriculum advancement (both reach Stage D at similar iterations).
            Both oracle and d435i hit the SAME local optimum: the robot balances the ball but
            doesn't actively juggle it to the 20cm target height. The apex-reward bottleneck
            is NOT caused by observation noise — it's a reward/architecture issue.
Decision:   The d435i degradation is modest and manageable. But the more important finding is
            that BOTH oracle and d435i plateau at Stage D with apex ~3/5. Before investing in
            noise scheduling, need to diagnose why the policy won't juggle. Hypotheses:
            (1) ball_apex_height reward Gaussian is too narrow (std=target/2.5 = 0.08m at D)
            (2) The policy earns more from survival than from attempting risky bounces
            (3) pi2 can't execute the fast height changes needed for bouncing
            Next iteration: investigate hypothesis (1) — check if wider apex sigma helps.

## iter_006 — noise curriculum plan + Stage D analysis  (2026-04-08T04:30Z)
Hypothesis: Documenting the noise scheduling design will clarify the interaction between perception noise and the existing juggling curriculum, and identify blockers.
Change:     Wrote docs/noise_curriculum_plan.md — 3-phase noise curriculum (oracle warmup → scaled d435i → full EKF). Identified Stage D apex-reward plateau as the primary blocker.
Command:    No GPU commands (GPU occupied by d435i+wandb rerun from previous iter). Analysis of tbdump metrics from iter_003 oracle baseline.
Result:     
  - Detailed metric analysis: ball_apex_height reward ≈ 2.9/5.0 needed for Stage D→E advancement
  - Root cause: policy converges to "balance, don't bounce" local optimum. Ball sits ~3-4cm above paddle (bounces from spawn drop) but doesn't actively toss to 20cm target.
  - Noise curriculum designed as 3 phases: Stages A-C oracle, D-F scaled d435i (25→75%), G+ full EKF
  - Alternative "noise-first" approach documented for if Stage D plateau persists
  - Updated fix_plan: marked tasks 3 and 5 complete, added Stage D plateau as BLOCKER task
  - D435i+wandb training rerun currently in progress (at iter ~150/500, PID 89008)
  - Answered Daniel's group briefing question via Discord
Decision:   Next iteration: warm-start from iter_003 oracle checkpoint for 500+ more iters (total 1000) at Stage D to test if longer training breaks the apex plateau. GPU should be free by then. If still stuck, lower _BJ_APEX_THRESHOLD from 5.0 to 3.5 to let curriculum advance.

## iter_007 — warm-start oracle + lowered apex threshold → Stage D plateau broken  (2026-04-08T06:30Z)
Hypothesis: Warm-starting from iter_003 oracle checkpoint (Stage D, apex_rew=2.92) with _BJ_APEX_THRESHOLD lowered from 5.0 to 2.0 will allow the curriculum to advance past Stage D since the policy already meets both advancement criteria (timeout≥75%, apex_rew≥2.0).
Change:     (1) Lowered _BJ_APEX_THRESHOLD = 2.0 (was 5.0) — committed to agent/policy branch.
            (2) Previous context session had already launched: python train_juggle_hier.py
                --pi2-checkpoint .../2026-03-12_09-04-32/model_best.pt
                --num_envs 12288 --max_iterations 750 --headless

            Checkpoint dir: logs/rsl_rl/go1_ball_juggle_hier/2026-04-07_21-56-16/
            (3) Built compare_pi1.py eval infrastructure (compare 2 checkpoints, diff table).
            (4) Added --noise-mode flag to eval_juggle_hier.py.
            (5) Added wandb video upload + descriptive run naming to train_juggle_hier.py.
Command:    [already running via PID 112352 when this context resumed]
Result:     Training ran for 749 new iterations (iter 225→974 in tensorboard), total ~1250 iters from fresh.
            Curriculum trajectory:
              ~iter 361: Stage D  apex_rew=2.86, timeout=98.9% — both thresholds met
              ~iter 380: ADVANCE D→E  (target 0.20→0.25m, sigma 0.060→0.055m)
                          apex_rew dropped to 2.07 — policy still close to target, just above 2.0
              ~iter 410: ADVANCE E→F  (target 0.25→0.30m, sigma 0.055→0.050m)
                          apex_rew dropped to 1.4 then converged to 1.1
              iter 547-974: Stuck at Stage F, apex_rew stable ~1.1 (< 2.0 threshold for Stage G)
            Final metrics at iter 974:
              mean_episode_length: 1415  (timeout=94.1%)
              apex_rew: 1.10  (needs 2.0 for F→G advance; ball hits 0.20-0.25m, target is 0.30m)
              ball_below: 5.9%  (oracle: best was 1.1%; Stage F drop height 0.50m makes misses more likely)
              noise_std: 0.319  (well-converged, lower than iter_003's 0.337)
              alive: 95.2%
              mean_reward: 55.1 (lower than Stage D because harder task)
            Checkpoint: logs/rsl_rl/go1_ball_juggle_hier/2026-04-07_21-56-16/model_best.pt
            KEY FINDING: Lowering _BJ_APEX_THRESHOLD to 2.0 SUCCESSFULLY broke the Stage D plateau.
            Curriculum advanced D→E→F. Policy is now stuck at Stage F (0.30m target) with same
            "balance not bounce" pattern. The ball doesn't reach 0.30m: policy throws to ~0.20-0.25m
            then catches, earning apex_rew≈1.1 per step (Gaussian factor 1.1/25 ≈ 4.4%).
Decision:   Stage D is no longer a blocker. Two paths forward:
            (1) Lower threshold again to 1.0 to force Stage G+ advancement — quick but may create
                increasingly weak policy that never actually learns active throwing
            (2) Reward shaping fix: use asymmetric reward (punish ball at paddle, reward ball above
                target) to force active throwing rather than continuous balancing
            (3) NOISE CURRICULUM: Now that Stage D plateau is broken, proceed with noise scheduling
                (fix_plan task: implement noise_scale in ball_obs_spec.py, integrate into _BJ_STAGES)
            Next iteration: implement noise_scale in curriculum (oracle→d435i as stages advance).
            This is the primary remaining blocker for sim-to-real transfer.

## iter_008 — noise-curriculum training (fresh d435i, 1036 iters)  (2026-04-08T07:30Z)
Hypothesis: Training pi1 fresh with --noise-mode d435i + noise_scale curriculum (0→100% across stages) will match oracle curriculum progression while building noise robustness.
Change:     (1) Fixed tuple-unpack bug in train_juggle_hier.py line 351 — status display assumed 5-element stages, now 6 (noise_scale added in iter_008a).
            (2) Launched fresh training: --noise-mode d435i, 12288 envs, 1200 iter target.

            KEY FINDING: Noise-curriculum run OUTPERFORMS oracle iter_007 at Stage F!
            Oracle iter_007 had apex≈1.1, noise-curriculum has apex≈1.76.
            The gradual noise introduction may be acting as implicit regularization,
            preventing the policy from over-exploiting oracle observation precision.
            Same Stage F plateau (apex < 2.0) but closer to threshold.

            NOTE: Run actually continued to iter 1199 (not 1036 as initially logged).
            Final state at iter 1199:
              mean_episode_length: 1485, timeout: 95.8%, apex_rew: 1.875, ball_below: 4.2%, noise_std: 0.283
            apex_rew trend at 1180-1199: stable ~1.81-1.88, not yet reaching 2.0 threshold.
Decision:   Queued iter_009: resume from model_1199.pt for 1000 more iters to push apex_rew to 2.0.
            With apex_rew=1.87 and rising slowly, ~200-400 more iters may be sufficient.
            Noise_scale at Stage F = 0.75 (75% d435i) — full noise at Stage G.
