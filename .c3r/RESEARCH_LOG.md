## iter_001 — D435i roadmap audit  (2026-04-07T00:00:00Z)
Hypothesis: The existing perception_roadmap.md was written for a mono USB camera; updating it for the D435i will expose concrete differences in noise model parameters, detection pipeline, and EKF timing that will guide subsequent simulation work.
Change:     Updated docs/perception_roadmap.md to reflect D435i sensor throughout: Phase 3 camera selection (D435i chosen, ELP rejected with reasoning), Phase 4 detection (depth from D435i depth frame not apparent ball size), Phase 2 noise model (σ_base 3mm→1-2mm, σ_dist 5mm/m→2mm/m, latency ~1 policy step), EKF timing (60-120Hz→30-90Hz depth), deployment stack (D435i USB3 + predict-every-5ms EKF).
Command:    Edit docs/perception_roadmap.md (6 targeted edits, no code written)
Result:     Roadmap now accurately reflects D435i. Key implication: depth accuracy is ~3mm at 1m vs ~65mm/m for mono — noise model is ~10× better at long range, which matters for Stage E-G (0.6-1.0m apex). Dropout mode changes from "ball too small to detect" to "IR reflection off shiny surface".
Decision:   Next iter: task 2 — survey Isaac Lab camera sensor API (RayCasterCamera vs TiledCamera) and document choice for D435i semantics simulation.

## iter_002 — Isaac Lab camera sensor survey → CAMERA_CHOICE.md  (2026-04-07T00:30:00Z)
Hypothesis: Surveying RayCasterCamera vs TiledCamera vs base Camera will reveal a clear winner for D435i semantics, with a key architectural finding that the ETH noise-injection approach requires no camera at all during training.
Change:     Created `source/go1_ball_balance/go1_ball_balance/perception/__init__.py` (perception package stub) and `perception/CAMERA_CHOICE.md` (full sensor survey + decision doc).
Command:    Read isaaclab/sensors/ray_caster/ray_caster_camera.py, tiled_camera.py, camera.py, sensor_base_cfg.py; wrote CAMERA_CHOICE.md.
Result:     Key finding: RayCasterCamera DISQUALIFIED — only works on static meshes, cannot see the moving ball. TiledCamera is the correct debug option (RGB + depth, dynamic objects, parallel). But the training pipeline uses NO camera sensor — ETH architecture injects noise directly on GT state, batched across 12288 envs on GPU. TiledCamera config spec written for debug/play use (30Hz, 640×480, 45° upward mount).
Decision:   Next iter: task 3 — create `perception/ball_obs_spec.py` stub returning oracle ball state with explicit zero-noise flag, consumed by policy agent's pi1 training script.
