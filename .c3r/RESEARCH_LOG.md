## iter_001 — D435i roadmap audit  (2026-04-07T00:00:00Z)
Hypothesis: The existing perception_roadmap.md was written for a mono USB camera; updating it for the D435i will expose concrete differences in noise model parameters, detection pipeline, and EKF timing that will guide subsequent simulation work.
Change:     Updated docs/perception_roadmap.md to reflect D435i sensor throughout: Phase 3 camera selection (D435i chosen, ELP rejected with reasoning), Phase 4 detection (depth from D435i depth frame not apparent ball size), Phase 2 noise model (σ_base 3mm→1-2mm, σ_dist 5mm/m→2mm/m, latency ~1 policy step), EKF timing (60-120Hz→30-90Hz depth), deployment stack (D435i USB3 + predict-every-5ms EKF).
Command:    Edit docs/perception_roadmap.md (6 targeted edits, no code written)
Result:     Roadmap now accurately reflects D435i. Key implication: depth accuracy is ~3mm at 1m vs ~65mm/m for mono — noise model is ~10× better at long range, which matters for Stage E-G (0.6-1.0m apex). Dropout mode changes from "ball too small to detect" to "IR reflection off shiny surface".
Decision:   Next iter: task 2 — survey Isaac Lab camera sensor API (RayCasterCamera vs TiledCamera) and document choice for D435i semantics simulation.
