# SIBLINGS — auto-regenerated at the start of each iteration

This file is your snapshot of what every OTHER agent in this project
has been doing. Use it at the top of every iteration (after reading
INBOX.md) to stay coordinated.

**To actually read a file from a sibling's branch** (without
checking it out — they're on separate branches to avoid conflicts):
```
git show agent/<sibling-name>:path/to/file
```

**To see what a sibling has changed since you last looked:**
```
git log agent/<sibling-name> --since='1 hour ago' --name-status
git diff HEAD agent/<sibling-name> -- path/
```

**To push a handoff file to siblings:** commit it on your own branch
and reference it in your Discord thread or in your next log entry.
Siblings will see it in their next SIBLINGS.md refresh.

## policy
- **role**: generic
- **focus**: retrain pi1 with noise-injected ball observations from the perception pipeline, validate degradation versus oracle baseline and restore performance via curriculum and noise scheduling.
- **status**: running · iter #3 · ctx 0%
- **last iter**: 2h ago

ce23add iter_007: warm-start oracle breaks Stage D plateau — curriculum advances to Stage F
83f62ad add wandb video upload + descriptive run naming to train_juggle_hier.py

## lit-review
- **role**: generic
- **focus**: survey perception-for-manipulation papers (ETH noise injection, teacher-student distillation, event cameras, learned state estimators) and critique our D435i+EKF approach
- **status**: running · iter #3 · ctx 0%
- **last iter**: 3m ago
- **parent**: perception (this is a sub-agent)
